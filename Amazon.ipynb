    "The dataset provides product and review metadata on 548,552 different products. The data was collected in 2006 by crawling the Amazon website. The dataset contains information about:\n",
    "- ID:product number\n",
    "- ASIN: Amazon Standard Identification Number is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com for product identification\n",
    "- Title: title of the product\n",
    "- Group: the product groups can be Book, DVD, Video or Music\n",
    "- Sales rank: the Amazon sales rank represents how a product is selling in comparison to other products in its primary category. The lower the rank, the better a product is selling\n",
    "- Similar: ASINs of co-purchased products, such as people who buy X also buy Y\n",
    "- Categories: location in product category hierarchy to which the product belongs (separated by |, category id in [])\n",
    "- Reviews: product review information such as the total number of reviews, average rating and the individual customer review information including time, user id, rating, total number of votes on the review, total number of helpfulness votes which means how many people found the review to be helpful\n",
